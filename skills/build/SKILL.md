  The PRODUCER's named loop (frame → terrain → build → judge): resolve a DEFECT into a VERIFIED green.
  Invoked TWO ways — by `judge` (which sends prioritized defects back; judge NEVER repairs what it audits) AND
  by the user directly with a raw bug. REPRODUCES first (red before any fix — a fix on an unreproduced bug
  repairs a maybe-non-bug), LOCALIZES the REAL cause (confirm which view/module/branch/build ACTUALLY runs
  before static diagnosis — never assume), fixes the NAMED cause MINIMALLY (no opportunistic refactor),
  VERIFIES red→green with an OUT-OF-MODEL artifact (test/exit code/screenshot READ/query — never self-judged
  text), GUARDS against regression, then LOOPS BACK to `judge`. Execution mechanics are CANONICAL in
  `_engine/ENGINE.md` Ch.4 — BUILD; this skill wires them and carries only the delta: defect intake, triage,
  the anti-blind reflexes, and the loop-back. Trigger on "fix the bug / make it green / the test fails repair it / apply the judge's findings / resolve the defects / it's still
  broken", or right after `judge` returns defects to the producer. Do NOT use to: AUDIT quality or decide if a
  deliverable is done → `judge` (`build` fixes, it NEVER judges its own fix); frame a need or decide WHAT to
  build → `frame`; prepare the observability harness / autonomous loop → `terrain`.

# build — resolve a defect into a VERIFIED green (the producer's loop)

## Purpose
**Take ONE defect to a green that is VERIFIED out-of-model — not self-declared.** Reproduce the bug red FIRST,
localize the REAL cause (the code that actually runs), fix only what's named, then prove red→green with a real
artifact (test / exit code / screenshot READ / query). The producer's loop: it fixes, it NEVER signs its own
quality verdict (that's `judge`) — so a defect is "done" only when an external signal says so.

**Produce under anticipated audit (a lever, not theatre)**: work as if an adversarial expert WILL audit this (it will — `judge`) and the gate WILL replay the signal — both REAL + falsifiable, so "looking good" collapses into "being correct": anticipated scrutiny raises the bar, the replay forbids gaming. (The lever sharpens the PRODUCER; it is NEVER applied to the judge/verifier — you want a true verdict, not one that looks good.)

## Procedure  (per defect — one at a time)

**0. Intake & triage.** One work item = one `RUN.md`; each defect = one entry in its `## Défauts` ledger (cite the proof the judge/hook gave). Several defects → order by severity / blast-radius and fix ONE at a time (a batch fix hides which change did what). Set the RUN header `regime:`. Place the RUN.md at `Audit\workspaces\<session_id>\<subject>-workspace\RUN.md` and set the `session:` header (session-scoping mechanics + legacy fallback: **ENGINE Ch.3 (RUN details) + foundation §1**). **A mono-defect fix has NO approach fork** → DELETE the template's `## Options`/`Décision:` scaffold (a repair scores no options; a leftover `Décision:` placeholder used to arm the closure anti-fixation gate — now also ignored gate-side).

**0.5 fix-gate pre-flight — before ANY code edit.** A TOKEN line in the session RUN.md: `CausalHypothesis: <verified cause + the file>` — this is what DISARMS the gate mid-flight (cause AND file, both required); or, for a one-off, an inline `fix-ok: <why>` in the edited file. No token → the **6th same-file edit is BLOCKED** (blind-fix backstop). ⚠️ `fix-file:` ALONE does NOT disarm mid-flight — it only green-resets the per-file counter. (Full mechanics: Reflex anchor below + `fix-gate.ps1`.)

**1. REPRODUCE — red FIRST.** Before touching anything, make the bug FAIL observably: a failing test, a non-zero exit, a screenshot READ, a query. A fix applied to an UNreproduced bug repairs a maybe-non-bug. No red → no fix; if you can't reproduce, investigate the repro, do not guess-patch.

**2. LOCALIZE the REAL cause.** Confirm which view / module / branch / config / **build** ACTUALLY runs BEFORE any static diagnosis — never assume the code you're reading is the code that executes (stale binary, wrong path, wrong project, another session's copy). Trace the live execution to the NAMED cause.

**3. FIX the named cause, MINIMALLY.** Touch ONLY what the defect names (reflex 11 — the unnamed stays intact). No opportunistic refactor, no "while I'm at it". Smallest change that flips red→green.

**4. VERIFY red→green OUT-OF-MODEL.** Re-run the SAME artifact from step 1 → it must now pass. The proof is the artifact (test/exit/screenshot/query), never self-judged text (reflexes 2 & 3). Without a real artifact: say "self-declared, unverified" — do not claim green. Close the RUN `green` only here (the Stop-gate replays the signal). **Adversarial coverage on YOUR own test (kaizen 2026-06-18)**: a test YOU wrote passing proves the happy path, not the absence of the bug class — for a boundary/discriminant fix, NAME an input that SHOULD make the test fail and confirm it does (mutation); if you can't construct one, status = "self-declared, coverage-unverified", not green. A self-Verify gate may PASS work downstream but is never the final authority that KILLS a finding about your own recent edit → re-challenge it (decorrelated pass / human), don't drop it.

**5. GUARD against regression.** Run the surrounding tests / a quick smoke to confirm a neighbour didn't break. A recurring class of bug worth catching → promote it into a `check:` line (the gate replays it).

**6. LOOP BACK to `judge`.** `build` never decides "done". Hand the verified fix back to `judge`; if the judge sent a batch, fix the next defect and re-submit the set. `judge` re-audits — an incomplete fix or a regression comes back here.

## Output

A defect is `green` in its `## Défauts` ledger entry ONLY after step 4's artifact passed, recording: named cause + minimal fix + proof artifact. Then `judge` owns the closure verdict — never `build`. The RUN.md `status: green` is the machine-readable signal the Stop-gate replays.

## Don't

- **No red → no fix** — never guess-patch an unreproduced bug.
- **The code you read ≠ the code that runs** — confirm the live path / build / branch FIRST (the #1 trap); never diagnose statically before verifying the live execution.
- **No bundled changes** — one cause, one fix; a green that bundles N changes can't attribute the fix or catch a regression.
- **No self-verdict** — `build` NEVER judges its own fix; that is `judge`'s job. Relayed report ≠ truth: verify the REAL artifact (diff / file / output), never the report on its word.
- **STOP-and-ask**: outside the harness · 3+ fixes failed in a row · genuine ambiguity · destructive/prod auth. Blocked (2-3 distinct approaches exhausted) → parallel resolver sub-agents BEFORE interrupting the human (reflex 9). Interrupt only for: destructive, out-of-scope, external dependency.

## Engine & reflexes

BUILD mechanics — decompose into signal-bearing increments, red-first then green, systematic debugging, checkpoint/rollback, anti-regression cadence — are CANONICAL in `~/.claude/skills/_engine/ENGINE.md` **Ch.4 (BUILD)**. This skill wires them and adds only the build-specific delta. On divergence, the engine wins.

**Cadence (mid-build — don't drift, kaizen)**: those reflexes are easy to read once and FORGET mid-fix. So they must FIRE during execution: verify EACH increment via the real signal (per ENGINE Ch.4), not only at the end — the **`build-cadence` hook** nudges after N code edits with no verify. Stuck ~3× on one cause → `scout` UNBLOCK (research, don't re-guess). Live reality ≠ the framed approach → re-`frame` (don't push the stale plan). This is the FIRING cadence + cross-skill triggers; the mechanics stay canonical in Ch.4 (NOT re-spelled here).

**Delegation (mid-build — fan out, don't grind solo, kaizen)**: the sub-agent mechanics are CANONICAL in ENGINE Ch.4 (**Parallel dispatch** · ≥2-hypotheses · resolvers) — build's job is to FIRE them at the right step, not re-spell them. **LOCALIZE (step 2)**: a non-obvious / multi-hypothesis cause → fan out N **decorrelated** diagnostic sub-agents (one hypothesis each → cause `file:line` + proof), take the CONVERGED conclusion (reflex 13); a diagnosis of YOUR OWN recent edit is re-challenged externally, never self-closed (reflex 2). **Intake (step 0)**: read-heavy recon (trace the live path across >3 files / an unfamiliar codebase) → delegate to ONE `Explore` → take its map (reflex 13). **VERIFY (step 4)**: the re-challenge clause already there = an adversarial sub-agent (or `judge`) contesting the REASONING. **Where NOT**: a trivial mono-defect (fan-out = pure overhead) · a sub-agent NEVER certifies green on TEXT without a real run (the artifact is the authority — reflexes 2/10) · the FIX stays SINGLE-WRITER (sub-agents diagnose/verify, they don't co-edit the same file — Ch.4) · cost bracketed by regime (≤2 / ≤3 / ≤5 — reflex 4).

Reflex anchor: **`CausalHypothesis:` before any edit** — a fix without a verified cause is a guess; the fix-gate blocks blind-fix loops (THRESHOLD = 6 same-file edits with no cause). Two legitimate escapes the gate ALREADY supports (`fix-gate.ps1:64-73`) — distinguish them, they are NOT interchangeable:
- **Real bug-fix** → `CausalHypothesis: <cause + source>` (or `check: <cmd>`) on a TOKEN LINE in the session RUN.md that also names the file. This is what **disarms** the gate mid-flight (it sets the cause AND names the file — both required, `fix-gate.ps1:64,68`).
- **Non-bug edit-churn on a long-lived UI/layout file** (responsive refactor, NOT a blind-fix) → put `fix-file: <basename>` on a token line in the session RUN.md. CAVEAT: `fix-file:` **ALONE does NOT disarm mid-flight** (a cause is still required for that) — its only job is the **green-reset**: a RUN with `status: green` naming the file via this token resets the per-file counter ONCE per verified-green transition (`fix-gate.ps1:67,71-73`). For a one-off escape on a single edit, an inline `fix-ok: <why>` comment IN the edited file disarms it for that file (`fix-gate.ps1:104`).
