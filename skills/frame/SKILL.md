name: frame
description: >-
  Step 1 of the pipeline (frame → terrain → build → judge). FRAMES a need in depth AND, if the framed need
  leaves an open choice of approach, EXPLORES the options — two passes inside ONE skill. Trigger on TWO trigger
  families. (a) FRAMING — whenever a request is phrased as a SOLUTION ("create X", "add Y", "make the script Z", "set up..." — but setting up the autonomous LOOP/harness for an already-framed need → `terrain`), when a need is
  vague (vague about a CHOSEN task → frame; vague about WHICH task to pick → `scout` first), or on "define/frame the need". EXPLICITLY includes creating a
  doc/README/CLAUDE.md/config: trigger to CHECK it doesn't already exist and to frame its content — creating a
  file that already exists (or that misses its real content) is a classic expensive trap. This is THE default
  entry point on any substantial work — trigger YOURSELF on a solution-shaped request, without waiting for the
  word "frame". EXCEPT (CLAUDE.md hard-gates): a pure ADVISORY question ("which is best / is it better to / what is / why", expecting a direct answer) → answer directly, NO frame; a still-OPEN form/premise ("not sure if X or just Y?", a question mark on the FORM itself) → stay conversational and converge the form FIRST, never route or fire a QCM presupposing a chosen form. (b) APPROACH CHOICE — the HOW for an ALREADY-chosen task (choosing WHICH task to pick → `scout`) — "which approach / architecture / library to choose for X", "explore the options" (of the already-chosen approach), "compare the
  approaches", "generate lots of solutions and have them vote", "help me decide between several designs". DO NOT use to: prepare the HOW of autonomous execution (→ `terrain`); judge the quality of a
  finished deliverable (→ `judge`); find WHAT to do on a target when no task is chosen yet (→ `scout`); run the
  heavy protocol on an obviously trivial, disposable AND already-precise one-shot (say it's oversized, offer
  direct implementation); nor throw 2-3 ideas around with no scoring process.

# frame — two passes, one skill: frame the need, then (if open) explore the options

## Purpose
**Understand the need at 100% — including what the user did NOT write.** Frame the real PROBLEM (not the
requested solution) and actively surface the **unstated**: implicit constraints, hidden presuppositions, and
the **blind spots the user never articulated** — so nothing un-asked sinks the work downstream. Everything
below is HOW that happens: the archetype questions pull the implicit out, the blind-spot sweep hunts what no
question touched, the board-gate auto-answers the evident and surfaces to the human only what genuinely needs them.

**Frame under anticipated audit (a lever)**: the Faithful `judge` WILL trace every need-claim back to a criterion (a stale/contradicted need = a defect it can flag) — producing for that falsifiable scrutiny tightens the need; it sharpens the framer, never the judge.

## Procedure

### 0. RUN file
Open or complete the **one** living `RUN.md`: `Audit\workspaces\<session_id>\<subject>-workspace\RUN.md` (kebab-case slug; `session:` header; session-scoping + legacy fallback → **ENGINE Ch.3 (RUN details) + foundation §1**). Set `regime:` (disposable | standard | critical) on entry. A `disposable` one-shot may need no RUN file (proportionality). Write `## Besoin` and (if reached) `## Options` here — never in separate files.

### Pass A — the need (always)

**1. Pre-checks — before any question:**
- **Solution in disguise** — "create/add/make X" is an answer, not a problem. Trace back to the underlying problem; impact of skipping ≥80 → surface it. Never frame the artifact before the problem is named.
- **Check EXISTING first** — single recon fan-out (ENGINE ch.1 generate, parallel) before framing anything, especially for a doc/README/config: does it exist, what does it cover. Cite facts.
- **Impact surface (blast-radius)** — MAP what the need will AFFECT: files/modules/configs/callers/docs/tests it touches, breaks, or must stay coherent with, plus what CONSTRAINS it (upstream deps, platform limits, policies). Single recon fan-out, parallel; cite `file:line`. Feeds scope-out (what stays INTACT) + success criterion; an empty map is a finding (isolated change). **Re-run (overwriting) if anything before `## Besoin` shifts the need** — new actor/output, overturned constraint, or changed delivery medium.
- **Trivial off-ramp** — obviously trivial + disposable + already-precise → say framing is oversized, offer direct implementation. Do not run the heavy protocol.

**2. EXTRACTION vs ANALYSIS** — two question kinds, never confused. EXTRACTION pulls what the user already holds (intent, constraints, taste) → ask them. ANALYSIS settles what only investigation can (what exists, what's feasible, what costs) → you go find out, never outsource it. Never dress an analysis question as a faux-QCM the user can't actually answer.

**3. Question phase** — pool of archetype generators via ENGINE ch.1 (Naive · Breaker · Contradictor · Perfectionist · Diplomat · Explorer · Pragmatist · Emotional), generated in parallel (one message). **Naive opens** (decompose every term, surface every presupposition); questions scored on merit (impact × autonomy-confidence). **Board-gate** auto-answers the self-evident as stated assumptions ("I'm assuming X, based on <fact> — correct me", never silently), surfaces to the human ONLY strictly-private / high-impact / genuinely uncertain. **High-impact override**: impact ≥80 → surface regardless of confidence (sole carve-out: a "why" they already stated). Stop when best raw impact <30, gate exhaustion, or round cap.

**Discipline (non-negotiable):**
- QCM-first — concrete choices before open prose; **one question at a time**, never a wall. QCM only when intent space is BOUNDED (by an artifact: log / diff / repro / stated constraint). Space still OPEN → open question, never a QCM — a QCM there locks the user into YOUR categories. **The moment the user rejects or redirects a QCM = your categories are wrong**: drop the options, go back to the open question; do NOT re-offer the same choices reworded. **Categories must SPAN the space BEFORE you emit (kaizen)**: when an existing artifact is in scope, the option set MUST include a "replace / refonte / start-fresh" branch (not only additive ones), and any load-bearing PREMISE of an option (a system state, a file's existence/value) must be verified with a cited check BEFORE emitting — board-gate the QCM's own premise (reflex 1).
- Refuse the vague — "three-nothings" (no nothing / no idea / whatever in a row) → reframe, never accept fog.
- **No solution during framing** — proposing a HOW is forbidden. The instant a solution is on the table you've flipped from PRODUCTION (you drive) to REACTION (you defend an artifact) — pull back to the problem.
- Anti-drift on opening: decompose each term and its presuppositions rather than widening scope.

**4. Blind-spot sweep** (Fusion-inspired — *what no question touched*) — before writing the need: which facet did NO archetype/question probe **and no board-gate stated-assumption already cover**? These are the **UNASKED** (unknown-unknowns), DISTINCT from open questions (known-unknowns deferred to `terrain`). **Loop, don't one-shot** — re-sweep, each round using a DIFFERENT archetype as a coverage lens (Breaker = unprobed failure mode; Naive = unexamined presupposition — its analysis use, not question-generation). Stop when a round finds nothing new (no facet with impact ≥30 not already listed). **Regime cap**: disposable = 1 pass · standard = max 2 rounds · critical = until 2 dry rounds, max 3. Name blind spots so they surface; high-impact one → ask it now rather than defer.

**5. Risk pass** — before writing the need, list **threats to the success criterion**: what could make this FAIL (dependency not ready, perf/scale ceiling, data loss / irreversibility, a stated assumption turning false, external blocker, scope creep). Each = **severity** (likelihood × impact) + one-line **mitigation/watch**. DISTINCT from blind spots (unprobed facets) and impact surface (existing affected): a risk is a KNOWN threat you can already name. High-severity risk with no mitigation → surface it (a need isn't fully framed while a fatal risk is unowned).

**6. Write `## Besoin`** (plain words the user reads — no internal labels): the real problem (not the requested solution) · scope in/out · a **verifiable success criterion as a cochable DoD checklist** (`- [ ]` exit conditions, each naming a PROOF — **format + rules: see `RUN-template.md`, the single source**; `disposable` may keep a one-line criterion — proportionality) · deliberate decisions · stated assumptions · **impact surface** (existing affected, cited) · **risks** (threats to success: severity + mitigation) · **blind spots** (Pass-A sweep's unknown-unknowns) · open questions left for `terrain`. **Short retro**: what signals showed up this run → patch thresholds so next time bites earlier.

---

### Between passes — forced path or open choice?

After `## Besoin` is written, decide: does the framed need leave a real, unsettled choice of HOW (which architecture / library / pattern), or does a single obvious path fall out of the constraints?

- **Forced path**, OR trigger family (a) only with no design question → **skip Pass B**, hand straight to `terrain`.
- **Genuine fork** (open choice remains), OR trigger family (b) ("which approach", "compare", "explore options") → **run Pass B**.

---

### Pass B — options (ONLY if an open choice of approach remains; else skip)

**1. Generate** by approach-lenses (ENGINE ch.1: MVP · robust · perf · lean · reuse-existing · creative · cost-first · UX-first · convention · contrarian), loop-until-dry, **dedup by core idea**.

**2. Score** in RANKING mode (ENGINE ch.2): typed criteria, fidelity as the eliminatory veto (~0 disqualifies), weighted sum post-veto; 2 decorrelated draws on subjective dims, median-then-MIN.

**2b. Adaptive deepen-vs-widen** *(AB-MCTS-inspired pilot — a score-driven DECISION over the EXISTING actions of steps 1 & 3; reuses step 2's `gg-1` scores, NO new scorer; **`disposable` → skip this step**)*: AFTER step 2 is complete, read the score distribution and make ONE routing decision before finalizing — **clear dominant top → STOP** (the net-new bit: early-exit straight to step 3, no extra round) · **top promising but rough → DEEPEN**: route through step 3's grafts (don't shortcut to finalize) · **scores low / clustered, no winner → WIDEN**: re-enter step 1's loop-until-dry with MORE divergent lenses (its ~12-candidate / 2-dry-round caps still bind). DEEPEN/WIDEN add NO new action — they route into steps 3/1; only the STOP early-exit is new. **Cap ≤1 extra round** — step 1 (WIDEN) OR step 3 (DEEPEN), not chained. *(worked example: scores 88/52/49 → dominant top → STOP · 70/66/61 → clustered, no winner → WIDEN · 84/80/55 → top rough vs strong runner-up → DEEPEN.)* Thresholds (dominant / clustered) = judgment — the score guides, it doesn't gate. *Caveat: superiority over plain one-shot is a HYPOTHESIS, unproven (a loop-policy's value is hard to measure out-of-model).*

**3. Top-K (3–5)** with trade-offs + grafts of discarded options' best parts.

**4. Blind-spot check across options** — a need-case that NONE of the top-K covers = a coverage gap, not a ranking detail. Note it in `## Options` (label `Uncovered case`); if it implies a genuinely distinct option, add it before finalizing the ranking — don't let the leaderboard hide it.

**5. Human decides.** Present the ranked top and let them pick. Only on an explicit "decide for me" do you pick the top-ranked and state why.

**6. Write `## Options`** — ≥3 scored, genuinely distinct options (the stop-gate's ⚓ ANTI-FIXATION will verify this before any engaged decision; straw options are a defect) + a `Décision:` line.

---

### Done
Hand off to `terrain` (regime propagated through the RUN header). **Never report "done"** until `## Besoin` (and, when Pass B ran, `## Options` + `Décision:`) are actually written in RUN.md.

## Output

`## Besoin` section in RUN.md — always. `## Options` + `Décision:` line in RUN.md — only when Pass B ran. Both written in the one living RUN file; never separate need/options/ledger files.

## Don't
- **Propose a HOW** during Pass A framing — that flips you from production to reaction.
- **Outsource analysis questions** as faux-QCMs — go find out yourself.
- **Run the heavy protocol** on an obviously trivial + disposable + already-precise one-shot — say so, offer direct implementation.
- **Claim "done"** before `## Besoin` (and `## Options` + `Décision:` if Pass B ran) are written in RUN.md.
- **Accept vague fog** — three-nothings in a row → reframe.
- **Use to**: prepare HOW of autonomous execution (→ `terrain`) · judge a deliverable (→ `judge`) · find WHAT to do when no task is chosen (→ `scout`).

## Engine & reflexes
- Shared pool mechanics — **parallel fan-out, loop-until-dry, dedup-by-core-idea, the two /100 scales (impact ⟂ autonomy-confidence), the auto-resolve-vs-surface gate, schema `gg-1`** — are CANONICAL in `_engine/ENGINE.md` **Ch.1 GENERATE & GATE** (question generation) and **Ch.2 JUDGE** (its scoring & ranking mechanics, reused for Pass B). On divergence, the engine wins.
- Reflex anchor: **solution in disguise = trap #1** — trace "create/add/make X" back to the real problem before framing anything. And **check what EXISTS before framing** (especially docs/configs): creating a duplicate is the classic expensive trap.
